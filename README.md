Was happy with the result, it worked a lot better than my previous attempts. Was some ambiguity about accessing dicts in lists, but then I moved the dicts from the list and
all was ok. I even remembered how to access the keys and the values in dicts [which seems kind of important.] This is probably my best project to date, although it isn't as concise
as it could be, the planning and implementation of ideas is improving. Can't think of anything wrong with it - The only thing it needs to only accept integers on the coin 
input.
